% % I would start with a quick content-aware description of the data and then describe the data in general, i.e., we basically have a long list of large unsigned integers.

% The actual data that we are working with can be seen as a large array of unsigned 64 bit integers, which corresponds to an $x$ $y$ $z$ stack of voxels.
