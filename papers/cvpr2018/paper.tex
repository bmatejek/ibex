%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
Advancements in electron microscopy image acquisition has created massive datasets petabytes in size that are too large for complete manual segmentation. 
Several previous strategies for automatic segmentation of these datasets rely work at the per-voxel level.
Oftentimes, agglomeration strategies build on top of this layer to produce neuron reconstructions.
Despite the success of these algorithms, there is significant room for improvement.
Here, we propose a novel framework for correcting errors in existing agglomeration strategies. 
We create a level of abstraction on top of the existing methods by reformulating the segmentations as a graph and applying global graph-based optimization strategies. 
In the process we provide key insights into the use of machine-learned shape features for fixing errors.
