\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Datasets}

This is probably where I should talk about neuroproof.

\subsection{Preprocessing}

What percent of edges are considered.

Figure (ADD FIGURE) shows a few segments that were not considered. 

\subsection{Classifier Training}

Here I need to produce the precision and recall curves, (ROC) as well as the final results with thresholding. Also include the training/validation loss functions overtime

\subsection{Experiments}
