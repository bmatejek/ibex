\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Datasets}

We evaluate our methods on three EM datasets. 

\subsubsection{NeuroProof Pipeline}

Our methods build on top of existing agglomeration strategies. For the purpose of this paper we used the outputs from two established pipelines.

\subsection{Preprocessing}

We perform significant pruning of potential merge candidates by considering only pairs of skeleton endpoints produced by Algorithm \ref{alg:generate-edges}. This strategy greatly reduced the number of false merge candidates that we considered. However, we evaluate the overall effectiveness of this strategy both in reducing trivial split candidates while maintaining a large majority of the candidates which should merge.

Our candidate generation strategy doesn't enforce an adjacency constraint which allows us to merge candidates that are not consider under existing frameworks. We examine the success of our pipeline in merging said candidates. 

\subsection{Classifier Training}

DISCUSS PARAMETERS FOR CLASSIFICATION

\subsection{Graph Optimization}

We evaluate the improvement of using a graph optimization strategy over a na\"ive approach that performs hierarchical clustering for all segments above a certain threshold.
