\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Datasets}

We evaluate our methods on EM datasets. The first dataset is the Kashtui dataset  which is a mouse brain (ADD IN STUFF) with an anisotropic resolution of $3\textrm{nm} \times 3 \textrm{nm} \times 30 \textrm{nm}$. The second dataset is from FlyEM and is a (ADD STUFF HERE) with an anisotropic resolution of $3 \textrm{nm} \times 3\textrm{nm} \times 30\textrm{nm}$. 


\subsection{Preprocessing}

What percent of edges are considered.

Figure (ADD FIGURE) shows a few segments that were not considered. 

\subsection{Classifier Training}

Here I need to produce the precision and recall curves, (ROC) as well as the final results with thresholding. Also include the training/validation loss functions overtime
