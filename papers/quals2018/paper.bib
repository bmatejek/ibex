	ABSTRACT={To stimulate progress in automating the reconstruction of neural circuits, we organized the first international challenge on 2D segmentation of electron microscopic (EM) images of the brain. Participants submitted boundary maps predicted for a test set of images, and were scored based on their agreement with a consensus of human expert annotations. The winning team had no prior experience with EM images, and employed a convolutional network. This “deep learning” approach has since become accepted as a standard for segmentation of EM images. The challenge has continued to accept submissions, and the best so far has resulted from cooperation between two teams. The challenge has probably saturated, as algorithms cannot progress beyond limits set by ambiguities inherent in 2D scoring and the size of the test dataset. Retrospective evaluation of the challenge scoring system reveals that it was not sufficiently robust to variations in the widths of neurite borders. We propose a solution to this problem, which should be useful for a future 3D segmentation challenge.}

Despite rapid advances in computing and imaging technology, current digital pathology systems have limited performance with respect to remote viewing of whole slide images on desktop or mobile computing devices. In this paper we present a novel digital pathology client–server system that supports collaborative viewing of multi-plane whole slide images over standard networks using multi-touch-enabled clients. Our system is built upon a standard HTTP web server and a MySQL database to allow multiple clients to exchange image and metadata concurrently. We introduce a domain-specific image-stack compression method that leverages real-time hardware decoding on mobile devices. It adaptively encodes image stacks in a decorrelated colour space to achieve extremely low bitrates (0.8 bpp) with very low loss of image quality. We evaluate the image quality of our compression method and the performance of our system for diagnosis with an in-depth user study.},

	ABSTRACT={WebGL is recent technology that exposes a computer?s GPU to a browser, and allows for the native generation of rich three dimensional graphics [1]. Compatible web browsers can offer a graphical experience comparable to more traditional stand-alone programs. As such WebGL offers the potential of bringing the "web"? to neuroscience, and has great potential to accelerate and support scientific research. Cognisant of these possibilities, we present ?The X Toolkit? (XTK), the first JavaScript-based framework for visualizing and interacting with medical imaging data using WebGL. The toolkit is geared towards powerful scientific visualization and provides a simple API (a 3D DICOM volume can be fully manipulated with three lines of code). Previous neuroimaging visualization using WebGL has been focused on specific data sets and is not easily generalizable [2],[3]. On the other hand, several frameworks for general WebGL development exist [4], but require a deep understanding of low-level computer graphics programming. Inspired by both approaches, we designed the XTK API to hide low-level elements of WebGL from users and offer native support of established neuroimaging file formats, e.g. supported files can be placed onto a web server and instantly rendered. XTK supports: surface meshes in the Visualization Toolkit, Standard Tessellation, and Freesurfer formats; single-file DICOM volumes and label maps in NRRD and Freesurfer formats; tractography files in the Diffusion Toolkit format; as well as curvature overlays. XTK is optimized to enable fast data processing and high rendering frame rates. The engine uses caching and optimized loops as well as asynchronous loading. The Google Closure compiler is connected to a CDash infrastructure to monitor the build process and track tests on different browsers. XTK, the build and test system, and all libraries are open sourced and hosted at GitHub [5].  <br/> <br/>[1] WebGL Specification, Khronos Group 2012, http://www.khronos.org/webgl [2] Ginsburg D. et al., Realtime Visualization of the Connectome in the Browser using WebGL. 4th INCF Congress of Neuroinformatics 2011. doi: 10.3389/conf.fninf.2011.08.00095 [3] Kelc R., Zygote Body: A New Interactive 3-Dimensional Didactical Tool for Teaching Anatomy.

For this purpose, we designed a software application, TrakEM2, that addresses the systematic reconstruction of neuronal circuits from large electron microscopical and optical image volumes. We address the challenges of image volume composition from individual, deformed images; of the reconstruction of neuronal arbors and annotation of synapses with fast manual and semi-automatic methods; and the management of large collections of both images and annotations. The output is a neural circuit of 3d arbors and synapses, encoded in NeuroML and other formats, ready for analysis.</p>},

	BrainGazer, a system which integrates visualization techniques for
	volume data acquired through confocal microscopy as well as annotated
	anatomical structures with an intuitive approach for accessing the
	available information. We focus on the ability to visually query
	the data based on semantic as well as spatial relationships. Additionally,
	we present visualization techniques for the concurrent depiction
	of neurobiological volume data and geometric objects which aim to
	reduce visual clutter. The described system is the result of an ongoing
	interdisciplinary collaboration between neurobiologists and visualization
	researchers.},

	abstract = {{Neuroscientists are developing new imaging techniques and generating large volumes of data in an effort to understand the complex structure of the nervous system. The complexity and size of this data makes human interpretation a labor-intensive task. To aid in the analysis, new segmentation techniques for identifying neurons in these feature rich datasets are required. This paper presents a method for neuron boundary detection and nonbranching process segmentation in electron microscopy images and visualizing them in three dimensions. It combines both automated segmentation techniques with a graphical user interface for correction of mistakes in the automated process. The automated process first uses machine learning and image processing techniques to identify neuron membranes that deliniate the cells in each two-dimensional section. To segment nonbranching processes, the cell regions in each two-dimensional section are connected in 3D using correlation of regions between sections. The combination of this method with a graphical user interface specially designed for this purpose, enables users to quickly segment cellular processes in large volumes.}},
